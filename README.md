# TrustedHostsEditor
 
A quick and easy way to modify your system's TrustedHosts list.

## How to use
### Add host
Click the Add button in the bottom right corner. In the window that appears, type the hostname (or IP address) of the host you want to add, and click OK. **If the name is invalid, the `OK` button will be disabled.** 

TIP: You can click the "Test Hostname" button to check if the hostname or IP address you entered exists. If you entered an IP address, this feature will automatically retrieve the hostname.

### Edit hostname entry
Right-click the hostname entry, and click "Edit". 

### Delete host entry
Click on the entry, then click the "Remove" button in the bottom-right corner.

### Save changes
Exit the application. You will be asked if you want to save changes. You can also click in the whitespace of the list box, and click "Update TrustedHosts"



## Extra features
- To copy a hostname to the clipboard, select the entry, then press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd>. You can also right-click on the hostname and click "Copy".
